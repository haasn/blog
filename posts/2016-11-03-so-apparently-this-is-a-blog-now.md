I just copied the template and code from
[http://blog.clement.delafargue.name/](this guy's blog) because it was the
first thing in [https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html](this list of Hakyll
examples) that looked reasonably nice (and I was too lazy to look at more).

## Why?

Because I keep spending time looking up things I've already documented on IRC,
usually in the form of “something broke, let me document how to fix it and
hope I find it again in the future”.

Hopefully doing it here should make it somewhat easier for me to find my own
fixes again.

## Why Hakyll?

Why not?
